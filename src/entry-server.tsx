/**
 * Renders a route to an HTML string for the prerenderer.
 *
 * Two behaviours worth knowing about:
 *
 * 1. renderToPipeableStream with onAllReady (rather than renderToString) lets
 *    React fully resolve the lazy() route components before output is captured.
 *    With renderToString every page would contain only the Suspense spinner —
 *    which is precisely what a JS-blind crawler would then index.
 *
 * 2. Under React 19, document metadata (<title>, <meta>, <link>) rendered by
 *    react-helmet-async is hoisted to the front of this stream rather than
 *    exposed via a Helmet context object. scripts/prerender.mjs splits those
 *    leading tags off and relocates them into <head>.
